# Linear-Regression-Using-Verilog
Linear regression is a foundational technique in statistics and machine learning used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable by fitting a linear equation. It is simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient, making it ideal for understanding trends, making predictions, and evaluating feature importance. The model assumes a linear relationship, independence of observations, constant variance of residuals, and minimal multicollinearity among features.

Implementing linear regression in hardware systems can be necessary for applications requiring high-speed computations, real-time processing, or energy efficiency. Unlike software implementations, hardware systems, such as FPGAs or ASICs, can execute operations in parallel, significantly speeding up matrix calculations and data-intensive tasks. 

This repository contains Verilog modules and testbenches for a hardware memory system designed to support linear regression computations. The files include:  

- **memory_in.v**: Module for managing input feature storage and retrieval.  
- **memory_in_tb.v**: Testbench for verifying the functionality of `memory_in.v`.  
- **memory_out.v**: Module for handling output storage operations.  
- **memory_out_tb.v**: Testbench for validating the `memory_out.v` module.  
- **memory_weight.v**: Module for storing and updating weights during iterative computations.  
- **memory_weight_tb.v**: Testbench for testing `memory_weight.v`.  

These modules are designed for efficient memory management in digital hardware systems and are integral to implementing linear regression on FPGA or ASIC platforms.
